It might be fair to say, with little distraction by the lack of live sports, that the greatest to grace the hardwood is an interesting and often controversial discussion worth discussing at a time like this.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Everything must be taken in context when grading such a stacked group of players. Training and building bulky basketball bodies was something you didn't see in the 90s, so LeBron's physical stature leads you to believe he would have dominated in past eras. Yet, the physicality of the game, like the case was with the \"Bad Boy\" Pistons is something James never encountered due to increased protection of players by the league. Another parallel could be drawn in terms of the heroics of Celtics' great, <person>Bill Russel</person>. Russel won 11 championships in 13 years which in and of itself is unmatched, but it should be noted that fewer teams in the eastern conference stood between Russel and a title, making the path to a championship far less convoluted. <person>Robert Horry</person> acquired seven titles with the Rockets, Lakers, and Spurs, yet everyone can agree that he isn't anywhere near the top-50 players in NBA history.</p>\n",

He is one of two players in history to average 30 points per game for their career, and has the most impressive stat line for a single season when he averaged 50.4 ppg, 25.7 rpg during the 1961-62 campaign.

Known as <person>Lew Alcindor</person> prior to 1968, The Lakers great amassed six NBA championships, six regular-season MVP awards, and made 10 All-NBA first teams during his illustrious career. His 38,387 career points is the highest total in league history, he ranks fourth all-time with 17440 boards, and has the highest win shares total of any player.</p>\n",

      "<p>No. 1 <person>Michael Jordan</person></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><person>Michael Jordan</person> became a larger than life figure during a career that included two three-peat championship runs with the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131364\">Chicago Bulls</org> during the 1990's. MJ's titles and statistics would be enough to make him the game's best, but his pop culture status brought him to almost mythological heights. Jordan is one of two players to average 30 ppg for a career, and even at age 40 while playing on a dreadful <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131366\">Washington Wizards</org> team his final season, Jordan average 20 ppg. His competitive fire is unmatched in basketball, and could very well be the case across the entire sports landscape. His Airness is the greatest clutch player of all time, and his numbers during key moments back it up. Jordan's career field goal percentage when taking the last shot is virtually the same as his overall career shooting percentage of 50%. Jordan's game had little weaknesses, and if you had to pick where he lacked the most, it was likely his three-point shooting. Still, Jordan shot 33% from range for his career, which was still above the league average almost every year he was in the league. Whether it was what he did for the Bulls, the Dream Team, or basketball as a whole, Jordan's name reverberates through the history of sports like <person>Babe Ruth</person> or Muhammad Ali.</p>\n",
