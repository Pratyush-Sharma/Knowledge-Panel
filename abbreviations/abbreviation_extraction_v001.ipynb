       "'Pointe  Bello  Promoting regional integration of economic and military development through the signing of  strategic cooperation framework agreements; and  Supporting the going out of Chinas defense industry, to include enhancing cooperation  with foreign governments and promoting Chinas nuclear equipment and technologies. MincanjunBoosting Private Sector Participation Over the last two years, SASTIND and the PLA have issued a number of policies aiming to boost private sector participation in the defense industry. Identified as a priority task in Document 37, opening up Chinas defense market to private sector firmsa concept referred to as mincanjun ( )is designed to acquire rapidly advancing military technologies and innovation spin-on into the defense sector via dual-use technology transfers or developing new products exclusively for military purposes.41 According to now retired LTG Li Andong (), a leading architect of Chinas armament modernization efforts between the early 2000s and mid-2010, civilian entities should participate in R&D and production of military equipment, as well as after-market support services like repair and maintenance.42 Doing so, he argues, would promote a more competitive procurement process.43 Promoting mincanjun is identified as a top priority in Small Group meeting reports. SASTIND is working in concert with key government agencies, the PLA, and defense enterprises to implement mincanjun directives. These activities focus on streamlining licensing processes, military and civil product standards, and constructing more transparent procurement platforms. SASTIND is also working with the All-China Federation of Industry & Commerce, a channel for the party and state to engage non-state owned enterprises, to attract private sector participation in the defense industry. The two signed a strategic cooperation framework agreement (SCFA) in May 2016.44 SASTINDs mincanjun efforts appear to be paying off. Private firms in China are boosting collaboration with state-owned defense industrial enterprises and research institutes to develop and deliver high-tech dual-use products. Results of this collaboration are showcased at MCF expos. In July 2015, the First China Military-Civil Integration Expo, co-sponsored by the China Association of Science and Technology and NORINCO, exhibited high-tech products from nearly 200 organizations, including NORINCO, Sugon, Tsinghua University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing Union University, and Military Transportation University.45 Roughly 2,000 representatives from the PLA, Ministry of Public Security, defense industry research institutes, and other government organizations turned out to discuss policies, business opportunities, and new defense technologies with private sector firms. These firms were showcasing an array of dual-use technologies, including command information systems, digitized soldiers, cyber security systems, geo-location products and services, infrared night vision equipment, and border monitoring and control systems.46 A similar expo, held in Beijing in December 2015, had more than 200 private enterprise participants showcasing UAVs, military robots, and cutting-edge materials. MCF exhibitions are designed to provide a driving force for the development of defense technology and the transformation and  22Pointe  Bello MCF: A New Path of Economic Development To date, SASTIND has signed SCFAs with provincial governments in Yunnan, Guizhou, Hebei, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shanxi, and Hubei as a means to promote development of local MCF industries. These agreements cite MCF as a new path of economic development. They promise joint promotion and construction of key MCF R&D projects and joint development of high-tech dual-use industries, which mirror breakthrough sectors of the Made-in-China 2025 initiative.54 Local government SCFAs involve one or more state-owned defense industrial enterprises, and highlight their role as vehicles delivering promised economic benefits. They also reflect SASTINDs ability to coordinate and direct defense industrial policy.55 Two brief examples may illustrate the composition and type of MCF industry development activities, as well as their connection to local government SCFAs with SASTIND. Hubeis Zigui CountyAugust 2013 In August 2013, SASTIND led the signing of a multi-party SCFA involving Hubeis Zigui County Government, Beidou Science and Technology Company in Beijing,56 Great Wall Computer Company, and Hubei KENTO Electronic Stock Corporation. The agreements purpose was to jointly promote the development of dual-use electronic and satellite navigation products.57 As a hub in Chinas Beidou satellite navigation system, Hubei is home to Chinas Beidou Ground Base Enhancement System (BGBES), a network of 30 ground-based stations, an operating system, and a precision positioning system developed to enhance the Beidous effectiveness.58 Leveraging Hubeis government-supported satellite infrastructure and reflecting provincial development priorities, the SCFA covered the construction of a Beidou satellite navigation- manufacturing zone in Zigui County, a locality along the Yangtze River. The Beidou S&T Company and Great Wall Computer planned to invest more than RMB 10 billion (USD $1.5 billion) in the zones development. The zone reportedly will be comprised of the Beidou Satellite Navigation Park, Beidou R&D and Manufacturing Center, an information security manufacturing center that will produce encrypted walkie-talkies and package semiconductors. MIIT projects the zones industrial output to reach RMB 20 billion (USD $3 billion) within the first five years.59 HebeiDecember 2015 Beyond its role as defense industry regulator, SASTIND also invests alongside local governments to form new MCF industry enterprises. In December 2015, SASTIND and Hebei Province led the signing of an SCFA to promote MCF big data technologies and big data governance, a target sector of Hebeis high-tech industrial development strategy.60 In addition to Hebei vice governor Zhang Jiehui () and SASTIND deputy director Zhang Kejian (), a number of military officers attended the signing ceremony, most notably the commander of the Hebei Military District, Major General Shao Heng ().  24Pointe  Bello 16  Among various sources, see Eric Anderson, The Political and Bureaucratic Influence of the Defense Industrial Lobby in the Chinese Policy Process, SITC Research Brief, January 2015, at http://escholarship.org/uc/item/8130b5h6; and Willy Lam, The Rise of the Military-Space Faction, Jamestown Foundation China Brief, Vol. 14, Issue 8, September 25, 2014 at http://www.jamestown.org/ programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=42875&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=25&c Hash=16eec90b1c201f57ae3f77c5e6ad6d95#.V2K_DpMrJsN. 17  Wang Yong rose through the ranks of the space industry\\'s 230 Factory, which is also known as the Beijing Xinghua Machinery Factory ().

Acquisitions, in part, are means to augment and fill gaps in domestic commercial and military development programs. AVIC acquisitions, primarily in the US and Europe, cut across industry sectors, including automotive and general aviation. Investments appear to target financially distressed small and medium sized companies with advanced dual-use technologies, R&D capabilities, and technical manufacturing expertise. AVIC receives financial support to execute its M&A and industrial development activities from the Chinese government. For example, in 2010, AVIC and China Construction Bank established a USD $3 billion private equity fund for the purpose of acquiring dual-use technology companies and investing in defense R&D projects to support the restructuring and development of Chinas aviation industry.103 As a strategic partner, the Tianjin Municipal Government pledged an initial USD $75 million to support the fund.104 Europe In Europe, AVIC-controlled enterprises have spent more than USD $1.25 billion acquiring aviation, engineering, and automotive businesses in Austria, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Spain. All of these firms provide AVIC advanced dual-use technologies and technical design and manufacturing expertise. For example, at the time of their acquisition, at least three European firms were suppliers to both U.S. and European military and civil aviation programs. In December 2009, AVICs Xian Aircraft Industry Company acquired Austrian-based Future Advanced Composite Components (FACC). According to its website, FACC is a leading force in the development and production of components and systems made of composite materials and a supplier to large aircraft manufacturers, including Airbus, Boeing, and Bombardier.105 Since the acquisition, FACC has become increasingly integrated into AVICs domestic civil aircraft programs. It is supplying a number of components to COMAC\\'s C919 passenger aircraft, including wing spoilers, winglets, and cockpit linings manufactured at a new FACC-AVIC joint venture facility in Zhenjiang, roughly 100 miles northwest of Shanghai.106 According to FACC, it plans to relocate additional projects from Austria to China both to secure the companys attractive earnings profile...and also to free up capacities at the site in Austria to support future growth.107 In 2013, AVIC subsidiary Technify Motors GmbH acquired German-based general aircraft engine manufacturer Thielert Aircraft.108 Thielerts engines powered the MQ-10C Gray Eagle unmanned aerial vehicle, a derivative of General Atomics Predator drone used by the U.S. Air Force. It also has been used in the military versions of the Diamond Aircraft DA42, a largely composite twin engine aircraft used for both manned and unmanned surveillance.109 Thielert was originally slated to provide engines to Turkeys indigenous UAV program, Tanka. After acquiring Thielert, AVIC announced a cessation to Thielerts military business line, consolidating the company, along with its other U.S.  36Pointe  Bello 5 . Chinas Expanding MCF Infrastructure: Demonstration Bases & Online Platforms Arguably the most visible sign of Chinas MCF development drive is the designation and formation of MCF industry demonstration bases (or zones). Prescribed in Document 37, MCF industry clustering fosters development of Chinas high-tech industry and spurs technical innovation by creating sustainable linkages between defense and civilian enterprises. MCF industry demonstration bases are a recurring topic in reporting from Small Group meetings. Based on public comments by its former director, SASTIND has had a leading role coordinating, reviewing, and administering MCF industry demonstration bases over the last two years.65 MIIT designates MCF industry demonstration bases as part of a National New Industrial Demonstration Base initiative. The initiative aims to promote restructuring and development of Chinas high-tech industries in at least six areas:66  Equipment Manufacturing;  Raw Materials;  Consumer Products;  Electronic Information;  Civil-Military Integration; and  Software and Information Services. Since 2009, MIIT has established 34 national MCF industry demonstration bases across the country. MCF industry demonstration bases prioritize dual-use technologies associated with satellite and satellite applications, other space technologies, aviation, advanced equipment manufacturing, special vehicles, shipping, new materials, and new energy. These priorities closely mirror Chinas broader high-tech industry development plans, particularly Made in China 2025.67 In June 2015, SASTIND director Xu Dazhe confirmed the close connection between the Defense Science and Technology Industry 2025 Plan, MCF, and Made in China 2025.68 Designation as a national MCF industry demonstration base does not appear to be an easy process. Provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities must submit applications to MIIT declaring the group designation they seek and the local companies operating or expected to operate in the base. Applications are submitted annually, and capped at two per province (or autonomous region) and one per municipality. Local governments eager to get on the MCF development path are constructing their own industry clusters. These bases appear to be separate f om MIITs nationally designated MCF bases, although local governments may eventually seek national-level designation. A Military AffairMCF Demonstration Bases PLA Military Districts appear to be involved in the administration of local MCF industry demonstration bases. For example, while meeting with Mianyang city officials in May 2016 to review the citys MCF situation, Jiang Yongshen (), commander of the Sichuan Military District,  29Pointe  Bello advanced equipmentwhether developed domestically or acquired from abroad. SASTIND has responsibilities for nuclear weapons, aerospace technology, aviation, armament, shipping, and electronics industries. In the economic realm, SASTIND contributes to national prosperity by stimulating the manufacturing industry and gaining competitive edges with superior production techniques. SASTINDs unique position, operating at the intersection of Chinas defense industry, government, and military, offers le erage when implementing MCF directives.27 The Central Military Commission The former GAD managed PLA defense R&D and acquisition policy, along with defense industrial MCF-related activities. GAD and MIIT/SASTIND appeared to have some overlapping responsibilities for managing defense-related S&T funding programs (e.g. 863 program), licensing producers of weapons and equipment, and accrediting defense laboratories in collaboration with relevant state agencies. Since January 2016, the GADs previous duties have been transferred to the newly created CMC/EDD, CMC S&T Commission, and the PLA Strategic Support Force. The CMC S&T Commissions mission is to strengthen the strategic management of national defense science and technology, promote independent innovation in that area, and push for the integrated development of military and civilian science and technology.28 The newly established CMC National Defense Mobilization Department is responsible for non-defense industrial aspects of MCF, such as mobilization, civil defense, reserves, militia, and border/coastal defense. Finally, the newly established CMC Joint Staff Department has responsibilities for deconflicting military and civilian use of national airspace.29 Specifics on how these new CMC organizations will coordinate MCF activities remain obscure. For now, however, public appearances point to a prominent CMC/EDD role in leading PLA defense industrial MCF work. For example, recent press reports highlight CMC/EDD and senior PLA officers taking part in national-level MCF meetings, expos, and forums.30 Having served in the position while assigned to GAD, the deputy director CMC/EDD Lieutenant General Liu Sheng ( ), continues to be the vice-chair and senior PLA representative on the interagency Small Group.31 That said, other entities beyond CMC/EDD, including the theater commands, are increasingly engaged in MCF defense industry issues, making numerous public statements regarding MCF work and visiting local MCF demonstration bases.32 The Inter-Ministerial MCF Small Working Group Guided by Document 37, the interagency defense R&D Small Group, established by the State Council and CMC in March 2012, oversees the implementation and coordination of Chinas defense industrial MCF strategy. Small Group meetings are held annually to review progress, issue work reports, and promulgate priorities. In most respects, Small Group priorities mirror the near-term policy proposals prescribed in Document 37 achieving breakthroughs in resource and information  17Pointe  Bello Visual 2 SASTIND SCFA\\'s - Government Agencies/Associations  All-China Federation of Industry & Commerce  - May  Focus: Promote private sector participation 2016  in the defense industry  State Intellectual Property Office  - March  Focus: Improve IP system to support defense S&T development, 2015  encourage private sector participation  Standardization Administration of China  - September  Focus: Improve coordination and development of new national  defense dual-use S&T standards system; promote going out of 2015  aerospace and nuclear (excl. nuclear energy) standards  28Pointe  Bello  Industry/  Name Name City/ Province/ Technology Description  (English) (Chinese) District Municipality Focus Harbin Harbin Heilongjiang Aerospace, Harbin Economic & Technology Development Economic & Advanced Zone prioritizes equipment manufacturing.

MCF and the Going-out of Chinas Defense Industry - AVIC MCF strategy affects the international commercial activities of state-owned defense enterprises. At a national meting on building the role of the CCP in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in October 2016, President Xi stressed with CCPs unswerving leadership over SOEs, defining their role as extensions of the Party-state. Xi pronounced that SOEs should become important forces to implement decisions of the CCP and major strategies, such as the going out strategies to enhance overall national power, economic and social development, and peoples wellbeing.87 The most poignant example of SOEs extending the each of the Party-state is the South China Sea where Beijing is leveraging SOE assets (e.g. vessels, drilling rigs, aircraft) to assert territorial claims in disputed waters. On the commercial front, defense industry groups are acquiring firms with valuable dual-use technologies and products with the financial backing of Chinese state banks. SASTIND has announced strategic cooperation agreements between Chinese state banks and defense industrial enterprises to support their going out strategies. Recent examples include:  China ExIm Banks RMB 35 billion (USD $5.26 billion) credit line for the China Electronics  Technology Group in February 2015 supporting CETCs international sales activities and its  going out strategy.88  Industrial and Commercial Bank of Chinas RMB 50 billion (USD $7.5 billion) credit line  for CSIC in September 2016 over a five year period supporting CSICs M&A, export, and  going out strategy.89 According to the US Department of Defense (DOD), Beijings acceleration of MCF initiatives is providing a conduit for the transfer of foreign advanced technologies for defense and dual-use purposes. Aviation and space industries are Chinese priorities and concern for DOD.90 Foreign acquisitions executed by state-owned defense industrial enterprises appear consistent with Chinese industrial policies for introducing, digesting, and assimilating technologies that lead to re-innovated products. As noted by Tai Ming Cheung, a foremost authority on Chinese technical innovation, this IDAR process can be described as homegrown.91 IDAR process priorities include aviation, space, advanced materials, and manufacturing technology.92 IDAR-related policies highlight the need to:93  Actively seek bilateral and multilateral technical cooperation;  Improve and expand open-source international information services that can be disseminated  to local actors;  Encourage and help Chinese firms to go global in order to gain access to foreign R&D  knowledge; and  Attract multinationals to establish R&D institutes and facilities in China. Extending Beijings Reach: Chinese Defense SOEs Under an MCF umbrella, Beijing leverages state owned enterprises to bolster territorial claims. In  34Pointe  Bello Today, MCF is a common theme in major CMC and State Council economic, military, and national security strategies.9 From the China Dream to Made in China 2025, and One Belt, One Road to the Yangtze River Economic Belt, MCF links Beijings economic strategic initiatives with military force modernization and advancing Chinas international S&T competitiveness.10 MCF policies are also reflected in the strategies of Chinese state owned enterprises, inform overseas mergers and acquisitions (M&A), international joint ventures, and collaborative projects with foreign universities. Underpinning MCF as a guiding national strategy is Beijings growing emphasis on state-controlled and directed technological and industrial development. This techno-nationalist approach emphasizes indigenous development, restriction of foreign direct investment (FDI) in key sectors, and importation and absorption of foreign technologies and know-how.11 In addition, the rise of a defense industry faction comprised of former and current defense industry executives serving in high profile government or CCP posts may increase the influence of the defense industry in government policymaking and accelerate implementation of MCF directives.  9Pointe  Bello  Industry/  Name Name City/ Province/ Technology Description  (English) (Chinese) District Municipality Focus Nigbo Yinzhou Yinzhou Ningbo, Advanced According to MIIT, the Ningbo MCF base aims District Zhejiang Equipment, to be a key vector promoting regional industry Military-Civil Electronic and upgrading and economic development.The bas Fusion Industry Information has four main parks focusing on equipment Base Technology, manufacturing, electronic and information  New Materials, technology, textiles and apparel, and new energy and  New Energy new materials.

Executive Summary Since taking the helm as the paramount leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) in 2012, General Secretary Xi Jinping has embarked on a dramatic shakeup of the countrys armed forces. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping and the Central Military Commission (CMC), the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) seeks to build a modern military capable of waging and winning informatized wars. A key pillar of Xis defense reform campaign is an innovative military industrial complex capable of delivering cutting-edge technologies to meet future requirements of the PLA. A cornerstone of PRC national defense reform is a concept known as military-civilian fusion (MCF). Further blurring distinctions between the PLA and civilian activities, the MCF concept is shaping Beijings economic and foreign policies, as well as the strategies of state owned defense industrial enterprises. MCF builds on well-established principles of civil-military integration (CMI), a process combining defense and civilian industrial bases to support military and commercial demands. Aiming to lower longstanding institutional barriers separating Chinas civilian and defense science & technology (S&T) systems, MCF policies also seek greater integration of civilian and military resources for improving national defense mobilization, militia assets, reserves, and border and coastal defense operations.1 However, MCF in the defense industrial context goes beyond traditional notions of CMI. MCF policies advance the construction of a national infrastructure that connects the PLA, state-owned defense research, development, and manufacturing enterprises, government agencies under the State Council, universities, and private sector firms. Acquiring and absorbing foreign technologies has long been an important part of PRC military modernization. The MCF concept, which was introduced in 2009 by former CCP General Secretary Hu Jintao in 2009, was elevated to a national strategy during the Third Plenum of the 18th Party Congress in 2013. MCF policy is becoming increasingly intertwined with Chinas broader economic strategies and the corporate strategies of state-owned defense enterprises.2 MCF directives appear to support the going out of state-owned defense enterprises. Supporting development of a self-reliant and internationally relevant defense industry, MCF policy, in part, appears to drive international acquisition of dual-use technologies and resources, and knowledge to fill domestic defense S&T gaps. A contemporary manifestation of Peoples War, MCF policies intentionally blur the lines between military and civilian communities. As such, motivations driving ostensibly commercial ventures and or research activities of defense industrial enterprises warrant greater scrutiny. They may also present compliance challenges for foreign companies partnering with Chinese firms. The PRC has had challenges implementing MCF-like policies in the past. However, Xi Jinpings consolidation of power, along with a growing base of defense industrial stakeholders, appears to be leading to rapid adoption of MCF policy directives. This includes a growing number of former and current senior defense industrial cadre serving in prominent party and state posts. An interagency working group has also been established to coordinate MCF activities among stakeholders and oversee implementation of national MCF policies, priorities, and assessing successes.  6Pointe  Bello 1 . Introduction Every Chinese leader since Mao Zedong has deliberately sought to leverage the residual benefits of integrating military and civilian research and development (R&D) and production systems, a concept known as civil-military integration (CMI), as a means of advancing defense modernization and supporting economic development.3 Former CCP General Secretary Jiang Zemin directed Chinas defense S&T system to focus on developing modern strategic weapon systems capable of targeting U.S. vulnerabilities. Under Jiang, Beijing emphasized a more self-reliant Chinese defense industry while also stepping up efforts to actively identify, acquire, and digest foreign weapons and technology.4 However, unlike his predecessors, Xi Jinping is marshaling a national effo t to remove the institutional hurdles hindering meaningful collaboration between Chinas military and civilian S&T systems and leverage dual-use technologies to support a more innovative and modern defense industrial base. Jiangs successors, Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping, have expanded the CMI concept, adopting a modified policy encapsulated in the term junmin ronghe (), or military-civil fusion (MCF), to capture Beijings vision of leveraging both military and civilian resources to construct a modern military capable of waging and winning informatized wars, while supporting economic growth.5 First coined under Hu Jintao and elevated to a national strategy by Xi Jinping in March 2014, MCF promotes dual-use technologies and joint building and utilization of military and civilian infrastructure, joint exploration of the sea, outer space and air, and shared use of resources such as surveying and mapping, navigation, meteorology, and frequency spectra.6 As CCP General Secretary, President, and Chairman of the CMC, Xi Jinping outlined his vision for MCF early in his administration. At the plenary meeting of the PLA delegation during the First Session of the 12th National Peoples Congress, Xi announced:  \" We should coordinate the development of our economy and defense capabilities,  and combine efforts to make the country prosperous and military strong. We should  further the great integration of military and civilian development, and work to  achieve in-depth integration of the use of infrastructure and other key facilities  based on demands and led by the government.\" Building upon Xis strategic vision, CMC Vice Chairman General Xu Qiliang outlined Chinas defense reform goals in November 2013:8  Improve research and innovation capabilities around defense S&T and armaments;  Strengthen Chinas defense industry system;  Boost collaboration and improve the defense S&T innovation system;  Reform Chinas defense R&D, production, and procurement systems; and  Guide private industry and high-quality social resources into military R&D, production,  and maintenance to promote military industrial upgrading.  8Pointe  Bello  Appendix 2  Table National MCF Demonstration Bases  Industry/  Name Name City/ Province/ Technology Description  (English) (Chinese) District Municipality Focus Xian Weaponry () Xian Shaanxi Aerospace, New Comprises 5 MCF demonstration zones: 1) Science & Energy, New Xian National Civil Industrial Base (space Technology Materials, launch vehicles, satellite communications,  navigation, satellite remote sensing, aerospace Industrial Base Advanced IT, new aerospace materials); 2) Xian Weapon  Equipment Industry Technology Industrial Base (advanced  Manufacturing equipment manufacturing, optoelectronics, new  materials, new energy); 3) Xian Shipping Science  & Technology Industrial Park (more than 20  MCF projects completed); 4) Hanzhong Aviation  Industrial Park (aviation); and 5) Weinan  Pucheng General Aviation Industrial Park (host  of the China International General Aviation  Convention).

The base has m e than 100 MCF enterprises engaged in aerodynamics research, aircraft engine development, special and new materials, and radar.69 He You, former director of the PLA Navy Aeronautical Engineering Institute, is a leading figure in Shandongs efforts to construct a MCF demonstration base. The base reportedly is seeking to provide operational and logistics support to Chinese aircraft carriers.70 After approaching the State Council and CMC in late 2013, He You and Shandong officials received support for the initiative from NDRC, MIIT, the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the PLA General Staff Department, and the PLA Navy in April 2014.71 Inner Mongolias Baotou Equipment Manufacturing Industrial Park Chinese defense industrial enterprises form the bedrock of MCF demonstration bases. They regularly partner with local governments, central government agencies (e.g. SASTIND), universities, state research institutions, and foreign enterprises to drive Chinas defense S&T development. With the rapid roll out of MCF development, however, many Western companies are now operating in MCF industry demonstration bases or partnering with centrally directed Chinese defense industry groups to support the diffusion of dual-use technologies, resources, and knowledge. While many examples exist, Inner Mongolias Baotou Equipment Manufacturing Industrial Park illuminates this shifting dynamic. Inner Mongolias Baotou Equipment Manufacturing Industrial Park officially serves as a national northwest base for heavy industry and national defense research and production. It was designated by MIIT as a MCF industry demonstration base in 2013.72 Baotou Parks MCF program targets eight areas of equipment manufacturing: heavy vehicles and equipment, wind power equipment, railway equipment, mechanical and electrical equipment, oil equipment, engineering equipment, general equipment, and specialized equipment.73 According to MIIT, Baotou Park is currently carrying out more than 240 MCF projects and aims for ten cutting-edge breakthroughs.74 The technical focus and timeline for achieving these breakthroughs is not clear. Baotou Parks emphasis on heavy industry and engineering makes it a natural operating base for a number of heavy industrial Chinese SOEs and defense enterprises, including Baotou Aluminum Group, PLA tank manufacturer Inner Mongolia First Machinery Group (also known as Factory 617), and Inner Mongolia North Heavy Industries Group.75 Inner Mongolias emphasis on promoting heavy industry has led officials to promote international cooperation with German industrial firms 76 Dual-use technologies and technical know-how resulting from legitimate Sino-German commercial ventures may have military applications for the PLA. Baotou Park is home to a number of Sino- German joint ventures involving firms such as Siemens, CLOOS Schweitechnik, Fritz Werner, and HESS Machinery.

In addition, a number of former defense industry executives and regulators have been promoted to senior CCP and government postings in Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Guangdong, Chongqing, the Ministry of Science & Technology (MOST), and SASAC. (See Table 1 The Rise of Chinas Defense Industry Faction) The SASTIND Effect SASTIND, which is the leading defense industry policymaking body within the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), appears to be an entry point and launching pad for defense industry executives transitioning to high-profile government and CCP posts. Since its reorganization in 2008, four men have served as director of SASTIND: Zhang Qingwei (; 2008-09), Chen Qiufa(; 2009-13) Ma Xingrui (2013-14), and Xu Dazhe (2014-16). Prior to leading SASTIND, all four spent much of their careers in the space missile industry, which now consists of two state owned defense groups (CASC and CASIC) and suggests a dominating position of these entities within the broader defense industry. SASTIND directors have served concurrently as heads of the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and China Atomic Energy Authority.19 One example of a CNSA MCF initiative was establishment of the Space Debris Monitoring and Application Center in 2015.20 Former SASTIND directors and deputy directors are now serving in high profile government and CCP posts. For example, Zhang Qingwei now serves as governor of Hubei Province (2012-present) and executive chairman of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics Committee. Chen Qiufa serves as governor of Liaoning Province (2015-present). After directing SASTIND for less than a year, Ma Xingrui was assigned to serve as vice secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee in November 2013.21 Xu Dazhe was appointed acting governor of Hunan Province in August 2016. All four were elevated as members of the 18th CCP Central Committee in 2012. Many SASTIND deputy directors appear to follow a similar trajectory, joining the agency from senior defense industry posts to take on more senior government and CCP posts thereafter. Current SASTIND deputy directors Zhang Kejian (),Xu Zhanbin (), and Wu Yanhua ( ) were senior defense industry executives at the China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), AVIC, and CASC, respectively, before assignment to SASTIND in 2014.

These platforms, which aim to facilitate S&T resource sharing, list the locations and technical capabilities of state laboratories, as well as new products or technologies developed or being developed by state-owned defense enterprises. These platforms also allow state-owned defense enterprises to post technical and resource requirements for ongoing R&D projects within their industry focus (e.g. aviation). MCF platforms are also being used to streamline procurement processes and reporting standards across state-owned defense enterprises, the PLA, and a growing private defense industry. Early successes, especially in military-civil R&D programs, has lead MIIT and SASTIND to announce an expansion and deepening of these platforms across Chinas MCF stakeholders. Approved by MIIT, SASTIND, and the MOF in December 2014, the Military-Civil Integration Public Service Platform is an online hub coordinating defense S&T priorities, monitoring relevant military-civil economic operations, and promoting commercial spin-offs of military technologies.79 The platform is accessible online, allowing SASTIND to post defense enterprise products, technologies and funding needs across eight categories: nuclear, aerospace, aviation, shipping, weaponry, electronics, information technology, and other.80 At the time of publication, nearly 600 military technologies and products were listed, including specifications and applications, investment requirements, supplier information, and points of contact. While the Military-Civil Integration Public Service Platform is new, content appears to be drawn from MIIT and SASTINDs annual Military Technology Conversion Promotion Directory.

SASTINDs most recent director, Xu Dazhe, describes his agencys accomplishments implementing MCF over the last two years, including:38  Supporting private sector participation in the defense procurement market via the  promulgation of policies that provide the means for investment of private capital into defense  industry fixed asset projects;  Publishing a new weaponry research and production license directory, and reducing the  number of projects requiring state-level approval by 62 percent;  Supporting innovative strategic alliances among defense industry and other civilian  enterprises, including the establishment of joint research and production units to leverage  technical achievements;  Signing MCF strategic cooperation framework agreements with provincial governments; and  Establishing MCF industry demonstration zones to promote MCF-related projects. In June 2015, SASTIND established a National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry Committee to further support MCF. Former SASTIND director Xu Dazhe, who served concurrently as director of the committee, pointed out that its mission is aimed to gather opinions and advice from leaders and experts in relevant military and civilian departments and units, and get external intellectual support for the strategic development and technological innovation of China\\'s defense industry.

T h ese acquisitions include Alabama-based Continental Motors, Minnesota-based Cirrus Aircraft, and Michigan-based Nexteer Automotive. Despite Congressional national security concerns about AVICs military ties, and the potential for technology diversion, the Obama administration has approved all of AVICs U.S. acquisitions to date. Aircraft Engines AVICs U.S. acquisitions target critical nodes in the general aviation production chaindesign, R&D, avionics, engines, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO). Engine design and manufacturing is a known shortcoming of Chinas aviation industry. Since 2010, AVIC has been acquiring U.S. aircraft engine companies, including Continental Motors, a pioneer in the area of full- authority digital engine control (FADEC) technology. It also acquired its sister company, Mattituck Services, as well as Danbury Aerospace, United Turbine, and UT Aeroparts. According to its website, AVICs acquisitions were driven by its special place and obligation to bring general aviation products to China.119 In April 2014, AVIC announced it was consolidating its aircraft engine businesses under a single corporate structure. AVICs newly acquired assets were transferred to a Hong Kong-based holding company called Continental Motors Group. Its subordinate unit, Continental Motors Group Beijing, was formed to ensure the Chinese market receives the exceptional products offered by Continental Motors Group.120 Advanced Materials and Manufacturing After acquiring the intellectual property of Oregon-based Epic LT in 2010 and Cirrus Aircraft in 2011, AVICs China Aviation Industry General Aircraft unveiled Chinas first domestically produced all composite business aircraft, the AG300, which is based on Epics Primus 150 design.121 The State of Tennessee offered Cirrus, a wholly owned unit of AVIC, funding and access to work with Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) as part of an incentive package to attract the firm to establish a new facility in the state. ORNL is one of the worlds foremost advanced materials, supercomputing, and additive manufacturing R&D centers. Additive manufacturing (AM) is a top priority of SASTINDs Medium and Long-Term Defense Science and Technology Development Plan (2006-2020). More commonly known as 3D printing, AM components are stronger and lighter, reduce aircraft weight, boosting aircraft performance.122 AM also has the advantage of reducing costs and cycle times of prototypes, tooling, and production systems.123 It does not appear that Cirrus is currently engaged with ORNL on any research initiatives and any proposed work would have to first be approved by the U.S Department of Energy.

An interagency policy body, referred to as The Inter-Ministerial Coordination Small Group for Military-Civil Fusion Integrating Weapons Research and Production Systems (Small Group) coordinates and tracks MCF implementation nationwide.24 The mall Groups structure (i.e. leadership and members) reflects China\\'s evolving and expanding MCF stakeholder infrastructure, decision-making process, and priorities. Although MIIT sits atop Chinas MCF defense industrial stakeholder pyramid, MCFs prioritization of defense requires close collaboration between the CMC and State Council, including review of defense industry enterprise licensing, developing and implementing MCF policies and standards, and other actions requiring collaboration between military and civilian bureaucracies. Atop the PyramidMIIT, SASTIND, CMIPD, MIIT is the principle State Council organ responsible for defense industrial policies. Within MIIT, key organizations include SASTIND and CMIPD. Both SASTIND and CMIPD were created in 2008 following the State Councils reorganization and establishment of five new super ministries, which included MIIT. SASTINDs predecessor, the Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND), was a ministry-level body and civilian counterpart to the former General Armaments Department (GAD). As part of broader defense reforms and reorganizations unveiled in early 2016, the newly established CMC Equipment Development Department (CMC/EDD) has assumed many of GADs previous duties. Today, SASTINDs director is at least a vice-ministerial level position probably equal in grade to a deputy director of the CMC/ EDD, as demonstrated by their respective positions as vice-chairs of the Small Group. CMIPD ostensibly develops and integrates defense industrial S&T standards and policies for both military and civilian products.25 However, it has limited purview over the defense industry, a core responsibility of SASTIND, and works largely behind the scenes. Its chief responsibilities include:26  Promoting the sharing of resources, information and transfer of dual-use technologies  between military and industrial partners;  Streamlining military and civilian standards systems;  Developing and implementing military-civil fusion promotion policies and reforms;  Coordinating defense grant programs and foreign cooperation on nuclear and space activities  with other Chinese agencies.

During the  13th fi e year plan (2016-2020) the zone aims to  attract one or two RMB 5 billion projects ($750  million); two-three RMB 2 billion ($300 million)  projects; complete 50 MCF projects; attract total  investment of RMB 30 billion ($4.5 billion); and  reach total output value of RMB 50 billion ($7.5  billion).  65Pointe  Bello While the list of MCF stakeholders is growing, the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND) is leading the charge implementing MCF directives and constructing an expanding infrastructure for fusing together military and civilian research, development, and acquisition communities. Just in the last two years, SASTIND has played a central role in: 1) supporting private sector participation in defense acquisition; 2) facilitating institutional alliances between defense industry and private enterprises, to include providing direct capital investment in MCF-related R&D programs and joint ventures; 3) concluding more than ten strategic cooperation framework agreements (SCFAs) between central authorities, local governments and industry associations for promoting MCF initiatives; 4) improving the system for drafting and implementing common military and civilian technical standards; and 5) establishing MCF industry demonstration bases around the country. With high-level support, MCF policies and their effects on governance and economic activities are likely to expand over time. The national MCF strategy transcends technical defense industry considerations. Policies call for greater fusion of military and civilian administration, at all levels of government, in national defense mobilization, airspace management and civil air defense, reserves, militia, and border/coastal defense. Under defense industrial MCF policies, authorities in Beijing are leveraging state owned enterprises, such as the China National Offshore Oil Corporation and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, to support territorial claims in the South China Sea. In addition to other actors, provincial maritime militia, comprised of civilian vessels operating under PLA authority, are also enforcing claims to alter the status quo in the South China Sea. MCF policies that blur the distinction between Chinas defense and ostensibly commercial related activities create a new set of challenges for foreign companies and policymakers. The deployment of state owned enterprises to bolster Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea exemplifies Beijings use of state assets as an extension of CCP policies and the difficulty of foreign governments to respond meaningfully. MCF also obfuscates an accurate estimation of Chinas defense expenditures and degree of PLA influence within the civilian state sector. With the acceleration of MCF-initiatives and the going out of Chinas defense industry, such challenges are likely to increase over the near term.  7Pointe  Bello SCFAs with Government Agencies SASTINDs SCFAs with government agencies focus on revamping regulations and standards impeding MCF development. SCFAs with the Standardization Administration of China (SAC) and the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) have led to the development of new dual-use S&T standards and policies improving protections of defense-related IP. National standards are critical to Chinas defense S&T development. They ensure detailed MCF coordination and provide a common language for domestic and international exchange and cooperation. SASTINDs September 2015 SCFA with SAC targets further development and implementation of the State Councils Directive for Deepening Standardization Work Reform and Chinas strategy to establish itself as a powerful aerospace country. It calls for:62  Improving coordination and development of a new national defense dual-use S&T standards  system;  Improving the Chinese aerospace standards system; and  Promoting the going out or internationalization of Chinas aerospace and nuclear standards. One early reflection of SASTIND-SAC efforts to internationalize Chinese defense standards was publication of the English edition of the China Aerospace Standards System and China Aerospace Standards. Defining 20 standards covering aerospace management, product assurance, engineering and technology and space applications, the new English edition addresses Chinese standards associated with satellite exports, construction of remote sensing satellite ground stations, and international cooperation.63 SASTINDs March 2015 SCFA with SIPO addresses an improved intellectual property system in support of defense S&T development. The SCFA is a clear effort to encourage private sector investment and participation in the defense industry. During the signing ceremony, the two sides unveiled a new Defense Industry Intellectual Property Center. Shortly after signing the agreement, SASTIND and SIPO jointly released 600 patents for converting national defense technology to the civilian market and supporting multiple businesses, including electronic information technology and advanced manufacturing.64  27Pointe  Bello  Member,  Name Current 18th CPC Past  Name (Chinese) Position(s) Central Position(s)  Committee  Zhang Executive Chairman, China Yes Chairman, COMAC (2008-  Qingwei Olympics Committee, 11); Director, SASTIND  2022 Winter Olympics (2008-09); Deputy Chief  (2015- present); Governor, Commander, Manned Space  Hebei Province Program (2007-12)  (2012- present); Deputy  Party Secretary, Hebei  Province (2011-present)  Zhang Vice Chairman, No Secretary, Provincial Peoples  Yinchuan Environmental and Congress, Provincial Military  Resources Protection District, Hebei Province (2008-  Committee, National 11); Minister, COSTIND  Peoples Congress (2003-07); Governor, Hunan  (2011-present) Province (2002-03) Sources: Information regarding positions were collected from a variety of sources including, Baidus Baike, Chinavitae, as well as official government and corporate announcements.  14Pointe  Bello Contents page 3   I.

MCF Blueprints & ArchitectsKey Policies and Agencies Driving MCF Development Defense industrial MCFs elevation to a national strategy has been reflected in a growing number of State Council and CMC-driven policy directives. MCF policies tend to focus on defense S&T priorities originally prescribed in a major joint State Council-CMC directive published in 2010 on integrating military and civilian weapon systems research, development, and production. Known as Document 37, the directive was promulgated at the end of the Hu Jintao administration and continues to serve as a blueprint guiding Chinas MCF development. Most notably, Document 37 identifies six barriers hindering the fusion of military and civilian sectors, which the Xi administration is continuing to tackle:23  Imperfect CMI coordination mechanisms between relevant institutions in government,  business, and research communities;  The prevalence of barriers preventing civilian enterprises from effectively participating in the  defense market;  Insufficient resource sharing between civilian and military sectors;  Incomplete reforms in relevant [CMI] institutional mechanisms;  Underdeveloped CMI industries; and  Poorly designed or incomplete policies and guidelines directing CMI activities. Though Chinese leaders have promoted MCF-like policies in the past, the rapid progress implementing Document 37s prescriptions can only be credited to the Xi administrations high-level support. In the last five years, significant advancements have been made to revise MCF policies and standards, construct online information sharing platforms to facilitate spin-on and spin-off technology development, and coordinate MCF policies across government agencies, the PLA, and state research institutes. Notable achievements include:  Fusing MCF within Chinas broader economic and industrial reform (i.e. upgrading) agenda,  ensuring adequate incentives and resources for promoting MCF at the provincial and local  levels;  Improving MCF coordination mechanisms between government, industry, and military;  Constructing national military-civil S&T resource and information sharing platforms and  directories;  Beginning to remove regulatory barriers to enable and attract private sector (Chinese firms)  participation in the defense procurement market; and  Constructing and designating MCF industry zones or bases.

United Kingdom In the UK, AVIC has launched multiple research initiatives with world-class UK universities and acquired aircraft interior designer and manufacturer AIM Altitude in March 2016. AVICs research activities are largely conducted through its Beijing Aeronautical Manufacturing Technology Research Institute (BAMTRI). BAMTRI reportedly has signed joint research agreements covering aerospace technologies and materials with Imperial College London and Birmingham University.111 Imperial College is working with BAMTRI through the joint establishment of the AVIC Centre for Materials Characterization, Processing, and Modeling. The center\\'s mission is to undertake applied and fundamental research; explore mutual areas of interest; disseminate scientific information and conduct post-doctorate and PhD project research.112 Housed within the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Department of Materials, the center\\'s projects appear focused on superalloys, notably the development of a direct powder forging process for nickel-based superalloys and aircraft windshield materials.113 Following U.S. Department of Commerce inclusion of BAMTRI on its watch list for alleged ties with a PRC national wanted for selling missile technology to Iran, the Financial Times revealed in June 2015 that AVICs high-tech collaboration with UK universities was under scrutiny by the UK government.114 Its unclear if the UK government took any actions related to these research partnerships. As a final note AVIC Trust reportedly is part of a Chinese consortium seeking to acquire a 50 percent stake in UK-based Global Switch, a large-scale global data center, for upwards of 2 billion.115 Spain AVICs most recent European acquisition involves the purchase of a 95 percent stake in Aritex, an innovative Spanish industrial firm developing, manufacturing, and installing production and assembly lines for manufacturers in the aeronautics and automotive sectors.116 In addition, Aritex is active in wind turbine blade manufacturing, railway, and renewable energy. Aritex is a top-tier supplier to civilian and military aircraft programs. Customers include Airbus, EADS, Embraer, Volkswagen, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz, among others. Aritex is reportedly responsible for designing and constructing the flexible wing assembly lines for the Eurofighter described as the worlds most powerful and reliable swing-role combat aircraft with max speed at Mach 2.0and the NeuronEuropes unmanned stealth aircraft similar in size to a combat aircraft. It also supports the assembly line and carbon fiber components for the Airbus A400M Horizontal Tail Plane (HTP) boxes.117 Aritex is working with state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of  37Pointe  Bello The Hebei SCFA announces plans to construct an MCF-related Big Data Industrial Base.

Beyond this vague mission statement, details about the new entitys corporate structure or the source of investment funds (e.g. a central government administered industrial or S&T program such as 863 Program) are lacking. Hebei plans to attract big data and Internet start- ups to the new industrial base by leveraging build-operate-transfer project financing and public private partnerships, with the goal of forming a center for providing all-in-one big data and cloud services for government, industry, and consumers.61  25Pointe  Bello Blurred Lines: Military-Civil Fusion and the Going Out of Chinas Defense Industry Authors Greg Levesque Mark Stokes December 2016  2016 Pointe Bello, LLCPointe  Bello 28  Yao Jianing, MND Holds Press Conference on CMC Organ Reshuffle China Military Online, 12 January 2016. http://english. chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/china-military-news/2016-01/12/content_6854444.htm. 29  See Cheng Li, Promoting Young Guards: The Recent High Turnover in the PLA Leadership (Part II: Expansion and Escalation), China Leadership Monitor, No.49, March 1, 2016, at http://www.hoover.org/research/promoting-young-guards-recent-high-turnover- pla-leadership-part-ii-expansion-and-escalation. 30  See Brian Lafferty, Aaron Shraberg, and Morgan Clemens, Chinas Civil-Military Integration, Study of Innovation and Technology in China (SITC) Research Brief, January 2013. 31  In addition to being deputy director of the newly formed CMC Equipment Development Department, LTG Liu Sheng (b. 1956) previously directed the GAD Services Department and Comprehensive Planning Department before his promotion as deputy director of GAD in 2009.

Modernizing Chinas Military Since taking the helm as Chinas paramount leader in 2012, Xi Jinping has outlined his vision for modernizing the countrys military and strengthening the CCPs absolute leadership over the PLA.12 To date, this ambitious project has included the prosecution of influential etired officials, defens reform, such as MCF, and reorganization of the PLA and the CMC, which has overall administration of Chinas armed forces and its subordinate departments. While these impressive developments reflect X s consolidation of power over the party, state, and military, a growing number of former defense industry cadre promoted to senior party and state positions may be facilitating defense reform and MCF policies.13 Strengthening the Partys Absolute Leadership CMC Chairman Xi Jinping has highlighted the need to strengthen the partys leadership over the PLA. The shuffling and purging of senior military officers arguably follows the pattern of his predecessors, including Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, to suppress military factionalism and ensure allegiance to the Party. Ongoing defense reforms, combined with the expected retirements of senior PLA officers at the 19th Party Congress in Fall 2017, are expected to further consolidate Xis authority over the PLA. Eight PLA officers were appointed members of the 18th Central Committee, including CMC Vice Chairman General Fan Changlong () and deputy secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, General Du Jincai (). Although the total number of military officers appointed to the 18th CCP Central Committee is in line with historical figures, a majority of them (40 of the 66) will most likely be replaced due to mandatory retirement age restrictions, including five officers on the CMC, at the 19th CCP Central Committee slated for late 2017. To date, two members have already been removed for corruption, while another 27 have already retired.14 To date, Xis anti-corruption campaign has led to the arrest of more than 52 senior military officers. In addition, 60 percent of the top 90 military officers ere appointed after the 18th Party Congress.15 These purges and appointments are helping Xi consolidate power over the PLA, ensuring implementation of his administrations military reforms and strategies, including MCF. Rise of Chinas Defense Industry Faction The political profile of Chinas defense industry has risen rapidly over the last five years increasing its influence in national economic and defense policymaking.16 At the 18th Party Congress in 2012, a number of senior defense industry cadre were admitted into the policymaking CCP Central Committee.

The law is intended to enhance Chin s military maritime projection.99 AVIC: A Pillar of Chinas Defense Industry and National Economy AVIC exemplifies defense industrial incorporation of MCF policy into corporate strategy. According to AVIC president Tan Ruisong (), the groups coordinated development of its non-aviation civilian business and military business reflects national MCF and aviation industry development policy directives.100 As a key pillar of Chinas defense industry and national economy, AVIC is the sole supplier of military aircraft to the PLA. Its business operations and military programs support a number of Chinas military and industrial strategies. As a premier state owned defense enterprise, AVIC is deeply involved in implementing and administering MCF initiatives. Public comments by AVICs chairman, Lin Zuoming, highlight AVICs importance to military modernization and economic development:101  As one of the important industries and key fields of the national security and the  national economy...Our mission is to serve the security of national defense and  economic development...AVIC always regards serve our country with aviation  as its core responsibility; adheres to military-oriented strategy, while supplying  munitions with high quality and efficiency, and guaranteeing military aircraft...

Xi Jinpings MCF policies began showing up in Small Group announcements in 2014. The Small Group\\'s leadership, members, and participants further reflect its role as a coordinating body and the growing role of MCF policy in economic planning. As noted above, MIIT Minister Miao Wei chairs the Small Group. Members span Chinas military, government, defense industry, and financial institutions. Small Group vice-chairs include the director of SASTIND and a deputy director of CMC/EDD. One source cited a deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) as a vice-chair.33 Over the last five years, the Small Group has refined priorities to reflect MCF-related pronouncements of Xi Jinping. Beginning in June 2014, Small Group pronouncements began to mirror MCF directives delivered at the 18th Party Congress and its Third and Fourth Plenums.34 For example, the Small Groups most important work in 2014, according to Minister Miao Wei, is studying and implementing Xis MCF development spirit and evolving ideas to break through MCF development challenges.35 Small Group announcements note hundreds of participants. However, special references are made to senior officials from the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC), SASAC, Chinese Academy of Science, Standardization Administration of China (SAC), the National Administration for the Protection of State Secrets, and senior officers from various CMC departments. Coordination of Small Group policy, planning, and reporting activities are managed through MIITs CMIPD. The CMIPD director serves concurrently as director of the Small Group Office, a staff that manages its daily affiars.36 (See Table 2 Notable Small Group Members) Small Group meeting announcements demonstrate the PLAs prominence in setting the direction of MCF priorities and activities. Senior military officers from the CMC regularly attend and speak at Small Group meetings. At the Small Groups third meeting in June 2014, then-Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Wang Guanzhong, highlighted Chinas complex security environment, need for weapon systems R&D and production to defer to, support, and serve military combat readiness requirements, and the importance of MCF in military planning.37  18Pointe  Bello  Industry/  Name Name City/ Province/ Technology Description  (English) (Chinese) District Municipality Focus Sichuan Mianyang Sichuan Aviation, Referred to as an important defense industry Mianyang Nuclear research, production, and human capital base, High-Technology Physics, Mianyang High-tech Industrial Development  Zone is home to more than 100 enterprises City Advanced operating in a diverse set of sectors including,  Manufacturing new materials, remote telemetry, nuclear physics  and radiology, radar, and aircraft engines.This  includes military research institutes, universities,  and defense industry groups (e.g. China Academy  of Engineering Physics and Southwest University  of Science and Technology).

In March 2015, the PLA organized its first online acquisition portal for general-purpose equipment.48 Chinese defense enterprises also have announced programs to enhance cooperation with private Chinese firms. For example, CASIC plans to increase engagement with private companies by outsourcing roughly RMB 43 billion (USD $6.6 billion) in Tier 2/3 defense and commercial contracts via an in-house online platform called CASICloud.com.49 Despite institutional barriers, private sector participation in Chinas defense industry appears to be growing. In the last five years, more than 1,000 private sector firms (roughly 40 percent of all Chinese defense contractors) were certified to research, develop, and produce military equipmenta 127 percent increase compared to the end of the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006-2010) period.50 The quality and depth of private sector participation is open to debate. SASTINDs core military industry production certifications, which allow research and production of complete weapon systems, remain finite. Security requirements appear designed to ensure only state-owned enterprises qualify.51 SASTINDs most recent director, Xu Dazhe, has committed to opening up more defense sector fields and educing entry thresholds for private firms, which primarily produce auxiliary defense products. True to its word, SASTINDs 2016 Special Action Plan announced the eventual release of two new catalogs for researching, developing, and producing military weapons and equipment.52 Until greater reform and opening up of the defense procurement market is achieved, SASTIND and the PLA are encouraging private sector firms to focus on building market share in secondary projects, which includes research and production of subsystems, auxiliary products, and special materials.53 Strategic Cooperation Framework Agreements (SCFAs) A recurring MCF theme is the need to improve coordination mechanisms across defense S&T stakeholders. SCFAs are one mechanism SASTIND is deploying to improve coordination between provincial governments and government agencies. At least 13 SCFAs have been signed since late 2012. SCFAs seek to overcome selected regulatory and policy obstacles that hinder MCF development. The also offer resources, including investment and technical expertise, for establishing new military-civil fusion industry demonstration bases. SCFAs between SASTIND and provincial governments highlight MCF as a new path of economic development and industrial modernization. These agreements regularly involve defense industry enterprises that seek to leverage local and central government defense S&T resources, such as universities, national labs, and grants supporting local industrial clusters. These industrial clusters are focused on transferring and producing dual-use technologies for both military and civilian consumers.  23Pointe  Bello largest electronics firmsCETC, ZTE, and Huaweiteamed up with Xidian University to create a vehicle for cooperation on electronic information systems. The platform is funded through Project 985. The platform, which became fully operational in 2011, pools resources and information of participants as a means of developing advanced military electronic technologies.83 Similarly, in response to Document 37, MIIT published a public and classified directory of more than 450 dual-use items, military equipment, and R&D facilities to support aviation-related MCF. The directories, which included cost estimates, encouraged local government authorities to support S&T programs of enterprises as a means to spur economic development.84 Expanding MCF Platforms Building on successes to date, MIIT is creating a larger and more integrated platform operation management system connecting Chinas MCF stakeholders. The system includes a secure means of sharing classified MCF information. MIIT promulgated a notice in December 2015 that provides guidance for constructing this system. The notice also announces the creation of a new office within SASTINDs Information Center to oversee the systems daily operations, and coordinate information collection. In addition, the notice:  Appoints SASTINDs Propaganda Center, China Shipbuilding Industry Corporations 714th  Research Institute, NORINCOs New Technology Promotion Office, and AVIC\\'s 301st  Institute as operations management support entities.85  Directs all MCF government administrators and defense enterprises (including the Chinese  Academy of Engineering Physics) to appoint a department responsible for supporting the  platform and collecting, organizing, reviewing, and submitting local MCF information.  Announces construction of a private portal facilitating dissemination of classified military  information across MCF stakeholders.86  32Pointe  Bello 7 . Conclusion Despite challenges, the PRC is gradually overcoming structural barriers that have impeded integration of its defense and civilian S&T systems. MCFs elevation to a national strategy and linkages with Chinas economic development plans suggest MCF will continue to be a prominent theme through the 19th Party Congress slated for late 2017. Beijings emphasis on acquiring dual-use technologies, and its deployment of state owned enterprise assets in Chinese territorial disputes, present new challenges for U.S. policymakers and companies. Defense industrial enterprises enjoy financial support and guidance from state banks and government agencies, particularly SASTIND. As a result, motivations driving ostensibly commercial ventures and or research activities of defense industrial enterprises warrant greater scrutiny. To date, the Obama administration has generally welcomed Chinese investments in the U.S., even in many strategic sectors. CFIUS reviews the national security implications of Chinese investments, like those by AVIC, which could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person.128 Factors informing CFIUS decisions are unclear. However, reviews do not appear to consider the acquiring entities previous M&A or investment activities, which is necessary to evaluate the broader implications of a single transaction. Most importantly, no mechanism appears to be in place that could enable CFIUS to re-evaluate the national security implications of an acquisition after it has been approved. At a minimum, U.S. national security and economic policymakers must adapt and respond to PRC strategies that further blur the distinction between military and civilian commercial activities.  43'"
